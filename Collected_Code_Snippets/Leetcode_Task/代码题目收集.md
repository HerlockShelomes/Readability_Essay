#### **3477. Fruits Into Baskets II** （1、）

##### Question Description:

You are given two arrays of integers, `fruits` and `baskets`, each of length `n`, where `fruits[i]` represents the **quantity** of the `ith` type of fruit, and `baskets[j]` represents the **capacity** of the `jth` basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

- Each fruit type must be placed in the **leftmost available basket** with a capacity **greater than or equal** to the quantity of that fruit type.
- Each basket can hold **only one** type of fruit.
- If a fruit type **cannot be placed** in any basket, it remains **unplaced**.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

##### Example:

**Input:** `fruits = [4,2,5]`, `baskets = [3,5,4]`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:**

- `fruits[0] = 4` is placed in `baskets[1] = 5`.
- `fruits[1] = 2` is placed in `baskets[0] = 3`.
- `fruits[2] = 5` cannot be placed in `baskets[2] = 4`.

Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return `1`.

##### Constraints:

- `n == fruits.length == baskets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 1000`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int numOfUnplacedFruits(int[] fruits, int[] baskets) {

​	}

}

#### **3471. Find the Largest Almost Missing Integer** （1、）

##### Question Description:

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

An integer `x` is **almost missing** from `nums` if `x` appears in *exactly* one subarray of size `k` within `nums`.

Return the **largest** **almost missing** integer from `nums`. If no such integer exists, return `-1`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

##### Example:

**Input:** nums = [3,9,2,1,7], k = 3

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

- 1 appears in 2 subarrays of size 3: `[9, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 7]`.
- 2 appears in 3 subarrays of size 3: `[3, 9, 2]`, `[9, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 7]`.
- 3 appears in 1 subarray of size 3: `[3, 9, 2]`.
- 7 appears in 1 subarray of size 3: `[2, 1, 7]`.
- 9 appears in 2 subarrays of size 3: `[3, 9, 2]`, and `[9, 2, 1]`.

We return 7 since it is the largest integer that appears in exactly one subarray of size `k`.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int largestInteger(int[] nums, int k) {

​	}

}

#### **3467. Transform Array by Parity**

##### Question Description:

You are given an integer array `nums`. Transform `nums` by performing the following operations in the **exact** order specified:

1. Replace each even number with 0.
2. Replace each odd numbers with 1.
3. Sort the modified array in **non-decreasing** order.

Return the resulting array after performing these operations.

##### Example:

**Input:** nums = [4,3,2,1]

**Output:** [0,0,1,1]

**Explanation:**

- Replace the even numbers (4 and 2) with 0 and the odd numbers (3 and 1) with 1. Now, `nums = [0, 1, 0, 1]`.
- After sorting `nums` in non-descending order, `nums = [0, 0, 1, 1]`.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int[] transformArray(int[] nums) {

​	}

}

#### **3461. Check If Digits Are Equal in String After Operations I**

##### Question Description:

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits. Perform the following operation repeatedly until the string has **exactly** two digits:

- For each pair of consecutive digits in `s`, starting from the first digit, calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits **modulo** 10.
- Replace `s` with the sequence of newly calculated digits, *maintaining the order* in which they are computed.

Return `true` if the final two digits in `s` are the **same**; otherwise, return `false`.

##### Example:

**Input:** s = "3902"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

- Initially, `s = "3902"`
- First operation:
  - `(s[0] + s[1]) % 10 = (3 + 9) % 10 = 2`
  - `(s[1] + s[2]) % 10 = (9 + 0) % 10 = 9`
  - `(s[2] + s[3]) % 10 = (0 + 2) % 10 = 2`
  - `s` becomes `"292"`
- Second operation:
  - `(s[0] + s[1]) % 10 = (2 + 9) % 10 = 1`
  - `(s[1] + s[2]) % 10 = (9 + 2) % 10 = 1`
  - `s` becomes `"11"`
- Since the digits in `"11"` are the same, the output is `true`.

##### Constraints:

- `3 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of only digits.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public boolean hasSameDigits(String s) {

​	}

}

#### **3456. Find Special Substring of Length K**

##### Question Description:

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

Determine if there exists a substring of length **exactly** `k` in `s` that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The substring consists of **only one distinct character** (e.g., `"aaa"` or `"bbb"`).
2. If there is a character **immediately before** the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.
3. If there is a character **immediately after** the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.

Return `true` if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return `false`.

##### Example:

**Input:** s = "aaabaaa", k = 3

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The substring `s[4..6] == "aaa"` satisfies the conditions.

- It has a length of 3.
- All characters are the same.
- The character before `"aaa"` is `'b'`, which is different from `'a'`.
- There is no character after `"aaa"`.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= k <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public boolean hasSpecialSubstring(String s, int k) {

​	}

}

#### **3452. Sum of Good Numbers**

##### Question Description:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, an element `nums[i]` is considered **good** if it is **strictly** greater than the elements at indices `i - k` and `i + k` (if those indices exist). If neither of these indices *exists*, `nums[i]` is still considered **good**.

Return the **sum** of all the **good** elements in the array.

##### Example:

**Input:** nums = [1,3,2,1,5,4], k = 2

**Output:** 12

**Explanation:**

The good numbers are `nums[1] = 3`, `nums[4] = 5`, and `nums[5] = 4` because they are strictly greater than the numbers at indices `i - k` and `i + k`.

##### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= floor(nums.length / 2)`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int sumOfGoodNumbers(int[] nums, int k) {

​	}

}

#### **3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I**

##### Question Description:

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the **maximum** difference between the frequency of **two** characters in the string such that:

- One of the characters has an **even frequency** in the string.
- The other character has an **odd frequency** in the string.

Return the **maximum** difference, calculated as the frequency of the character with an **odd** frequency **minus** the frequency of the character with an **even** frequency.

##### Example:

**Input:** s = "aaaaabbc"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of `5`, and `'b'` has an **even frequency** of `2`.
- The maximum difference is `5 - 2 = 3`.

##### Constraints:

- `3 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
- `s` contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

#### **Sum of K Subarrays With Length at Least M**

##### Question Description:

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers, `k` and `m`.

Return the **maximum** sum of `k` non-overlapping subarrays of `nums`, where each subarray has a length of **at least** `m`.

##### Example:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,-1,3,3,4]`, `k = 2`, `m = 2`

**Output:** 13

**Explanation:**

The optimal choice is:

- Subarray `nums[3..5]` with sum `3 + 3 + 4 = 10` (length is `3 >= m`).
- Subarray `nums[0..1]` with sum `1 + 2 = 3` (length is `2 >= m`).

#### **Find the Number of Copy Arrays**

##### Question Description:

You are given an array `original` of length `n` and a 2D array `bounds` of length `n x 2`, where `bounds[i] = [ui, vi]`.

You need to find the number of **possible** arrays `copy` of length `n` such that:

1. `(copy[i] - copy[i - 1]) == (original[i] - original[i - 1])` for `1 <= i <= n - 1`.
2. `ui <= copy[i] <= vi` for `0 <= i <= n - 1`.

Return the number of such arrays.

##### Example:

**Input:** `original = [1,2,3,4]`, `bounds = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]`

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The possible arrays are:

- `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

### 字符串处理

#### **Longest Palindromic Subsequence After at Most K Operations**

##### Question Description:

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can replace the character at any position with the next or previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'a'` is after `'z'`). For example, replacing `'a'` with the next letter results in `'b'`, and replacing `'a'` with the previous letter results in `'z'`. Similarly, replacing `'z'` with the next letter results in `'a'`, and replacing `'z'` with the previous letter results in `'y'`.

Return the length of the **longest palindromic subsequence** of `s` that can be obtained after performing **at most** `k` operations.

##### Example:

**Input:** `s = "abced"`, `k = 2`

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Replace `s[1]` with the next letter, and `s` becomes `"acced"`.
- Replace `s[4]` with the previous letter, and `s` becomes `"accec"`.

The subsequence `"ccc"` forms a palindrome of length 3, which is the maximum.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `1 <= k <= 200`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int longestPalindromicSubsequence(String s, int k) {

​	}

}

#### **Select K Disjoint Special Substrings**

##### Question Description:

Given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, determine whether it is possible to select `k` disjoint **special substrings**.

A **special substring** is a substring where:

- Any character present inside the substring should not appear outside it in the string.
- The substring is not the entire string `s`.

**Note** that all `k` substrings must be disjoint, meaning they cannot overlap.

Return `true` if it is possible to select `k` such disjoint special substrings; otherwise, return `false`.

##### Example:

**Input:** `s = "abcdbaefab"`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `true`

**Explanation:**

- We can select two disjoint special substrings: `"cd"` and `"ef"`.
- `"cd"` contains the characters `'c'` and `'d'`, which do not appear elsewhere in `s`.
- `"ef"` contains the characters `'e'` and `'f'`, which do not appear elsewhere in `s`.

##### Constraints:

- `2 <= n == s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= k <= 26`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public boolean maxSubstringLength(String s, int k) {

​	}

}

### 排序算法

#### **Choose K Elements With Maximum Sum**

##### Question Description:

You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`, along with a positive integer `k`.

For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, perform the following:

- Find **all** indices `j` where `nums1[j]` is less than `nums1[i]`.
- Choose **at most** `k` values of `nums2[j]` at these indices to **maximize** the total sum.

Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` represents the result for the corresponding index `i`.

##### Example:

**Input:** `nums1 = [4,2,1,5,3]`, `nums2 = [10,20,30,40,50]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `[80,30,0,80,50]`

**Explanation:**

- For `i = 0`: Select the 2 largest values from `nums2` at indices `[1, 2, 4]` where `nums1[j] < nums1[0]`, resulting in `50 + 30 = 80`.
- For `i = 1`: Select the 2 largest values from `nums2` at index `[2]` where `nums1[j] < nums1[1]`, resulting in `30`.
- For `i = 2`: No indices satisfy `nums1[j] < nums1[2]`, resulting in `0`.
- For `i = 3`: Select the 2 largest values from `nums2` at indices `[0, 1, 2, 4]` where `nums1[j] < nums1[3]`, resulting in `50 + 30 = 80`.
- For `i = 4`: Select the 2 largest values from `nums2` at indices `[1, 2]` where `nums1[j] < nums1[4]`, resulting in `30 + 20 = 50`.

##### Constraints:

- `n == nums1.length == nums2.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106`
- `1 <= k <= n`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

​	public long[] findMaxSum(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k) {

​	}

}

#### **Maximum Sum With at Most K Elements**

##### Question Description:

You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `n x m`, an integer array `limits` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. The task is to find the **maximum sum** of **at most** `k` elements from the matrix `grid` such that:

- The number of elements taken from the `ith` row of `grid` does not exceed `limits[i]`.

Return the **maximum sum**.

##### Example:

**Input:** `grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]`, `limits = [1,2]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

- From the second row, we can take at most 2 elements. The elements taken are `4` and `3`.
- The maximum possible sum of at most 2 selected elements is `4 + 3 = 7`.

##### Constraints:

- `n == grid.length == limits.length`
- `m == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 500`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`
- `0 <= limits[i] <= m`
