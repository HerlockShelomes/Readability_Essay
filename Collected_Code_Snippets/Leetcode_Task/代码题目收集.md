### 数组处理

#### **Sum of K Subarrays With Length at Least M**

##### Question Description:

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers, `k` and `m`.

Return the **maximum** sum of `k` non-overlapping subarrays of `nums`, where each subarray has a length of **at least** `m`.

##### Example:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,-1,3,3,4]`, `k = 2`, `m = 2`

**Output:** 13

**Explanation:**

The optimal choice is:

- Subarray `nums[3..5]` with sum `3 + 3 + 4 = 10` (length is `3 >= m`).
- Subarray `nums[0..1]` with sum `1 + 2 = 3` (length is `2 >= m`).

The total sum is `10 + 3 = 13`.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `1 <= k <= floor(nums.length / m)`
- `1 <= m <= 3`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int maxSum(int[] nums, int k, int m) {

​	}

}

#### **Find the Number of Copy Arrays**

##### Question Description:

You are given an array `original` of length `n` and a 2D array `bounds` of length `n x 2`, where `bounds[i] = [ui, vi]`.

You need to find the number of **possible** arrays `copy` of length `n` such that:

1. `(copy[i] - copy[i - 1]) == (original[i] - original[i - 1])` for `1 <= i <= n - 1`.
2. `ui <= copy[i] <= vi` for `0 <= i <= n - 1`.

Return the number of such arrays.

##### Example:

**Input:** `original = [1,2,3,4]`, `bounds = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]`

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

The possible arrays are:

- `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `[2, 3, 4, 5]`

##### Constraints:

- `2 <= n == original.length <= 105`
- `1 <= original[i] <= 109`
- `bounds.length == n`
- `bounds[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= bounds[i][0] <= bounds[i][1] <= 109`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int countArrays(int[] original, int[][] bounds) {        

​	}

}

### 字符串处理

#### **Longest Palindromic Subsequence After at Most K Operations**

##### Question Description:

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can replace the character at any position with the next or previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'a'` is after `'z'`). For example, replacing `'a'` with the next letter results in `'b'`, and replacing `'a'` with the previous letter results in `'z'`. Similarly, replacing `'z'` with the next letter results in `'a'`, and replacing `'z'` with the previous letter results in `'y'`.

Return the length of the **longest palindromic subsequence** of `s` that can be obtained after performing **at most** `k` operations.

##### Example:

**Input:** `s = "abced"`, `k = 2`

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

- Replace `s[1]` with the next letter, and `s` becomes `"acced"`.
- Replace `s[4]` with the previous letter, and `s` becomes `"accec"`.

The subsequence `"ccc"` forms a palindrome of length 3, which is the maximum.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 200`
- `1 <= k <= 200`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int longestPalindromicSubsequence(String s, int k) {

​	}

}

#### **Select K Disjoint Special Substrings**

##### Question Description:

Given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, determine whether it is possible to select `k` disjoint **special substrings**.

A **special substring** is a substring where:

- Any character present inside the substring should not appear outside it in the string.
- The substring is not the entire string `s`.

**Note** that all `k` substrings must be disjoint, meaning they cannot overlap.

Return `true` if it is possible to select `k` such disjoint special substrings; otherwise, return `false`.

##### Example:

**Input:** `s = "abcdbaefab"`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `true`

**Explanation:**

- We can select two disjoint special substrings: `"cd"` and `"ef"`.
- `"cd"` contains the characters `'c'` and `'d'`, which do not appear elsewhere in `s`.
- `"ef"` contains the characters `'e'` and `'f'`, which do not appear elsewhere in `s`.

##### Constraints:

- `2 <= n == s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= k <= 26`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public boolean maxSubstringLength(String s, int k) {

​	}

}
