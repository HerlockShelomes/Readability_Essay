#### **Fruits Into Baskets II**

##### Question Description:

You are given two arrays of integers, `fruits` and `baskets`, each of length `n`, where `fruits[i]` represents the **quantity** of the `ith` type of fruit, and `baskets[j]` represents the **capacity** of the `jth` basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

- Each fruit type must be placed in the **leftmost available basket** with a capacity **greater than or equal** to the quantity of that fruit type.
- Each basket can hold **only one** type of fruit.
- If a fruit type **cannot be placed** in any basket, it remains **unplaced**.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

##### Example:

**Input:** `fruits = [4,2,5]`, `baskets = [3,5,4]`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:**

- `fruits[0] = 4` is placed in `baskets[1] = 5`.
- `fruits[1] = 2` is placed in `baskets[0] = 3`.
- `fruits[2] = 5` cannot be placed in `baskets[2] = 4`.

Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return `1`.

##### Constraints:

- `n == fruits.length == baskets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 1000`

##### Please write Java code in the following structure:

class Solution {

​	public int numOfUnplacedFruits(int[] fruits, int[] baskets) {

​	}

}
